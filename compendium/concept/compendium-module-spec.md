  text: "The spec of a cross-cutting vocabulary substrate that navigates and synthesizes the module specs but does not restate their normative content — a source of information, not a source of truth. Full definition lives in owner_spec."
glosses:
  - { register: expert, text: "concept-anchored dual-register glossary + pointer-not-paraphrase charter + computed-MOC wiki + 4 lints, one-way authority Compendium->spec" }
  - { register: plain,  text: "a glossary module that gathers terms from several modules in one place but only points to each module's own document for the real explanation" }
terms:
  - { text: Compendium, register: expert, role: preferred,

The self-application entry: this store treats its own spec as a concept entry (Appendix B dogfood). Because the spec satisfies the very frontmatter form it defines, it holds the authority to apply that form to other entries. The normative definition is owned by [`Compendium.md` §1](../../Compendium.md#1-concept--what-compendium-is); this entry is a one-line orientation gloss plus the pointer, not a restatement.
