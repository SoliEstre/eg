Orientation primer only — the normative definition is owned by [`Constellation.md` §13.13](../../Constellation.md#1313-a2a-message-reliability--the-ack-layer). Compendium holds a one-line gloss plus the pointer; it does **not** restate the ack-layer contract. For the three-tier transport / commitment / application model and the at-least-once relay semantics, read the owner spec.
