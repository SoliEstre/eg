# WS-PROTOCOL: UI6 Selection Prompts (Draft v0.1)

**Status**: DRAFT — pending main implementation review
**Track**: WS-PROTOCOL extension (companion to §13.11 HELLO / §13.13 A2A ack; **independent** of `WS-PROTOCOL-KEY-MGMT.md`)
**Provenance**:
- User feature **#406** (main hub, 2026-05-31) — Liveboard UI 5-item set; UI 6 is the **6th** item added in the same feature thread (live-board real-time chat window with agent-emitted option prompts).
- main delegate **seq 77** (`m-mpt4dja7-76`) introduced the 5-item UI set; UI 6 was tacked on as a chat-thread interactivity ask.
- main delegate **seq 88** (`m-mpt5o07l-87`, 2026-05-31) — "UI 4·5 키관리와 함께 server.cjs 프로토콜 묶음 설계" — requested this draft alongside `WS-PROTOCOL-KEY-MGMT.md`. **Bundling decision** (this draft): keep KEY-MGMT and UI6 in **separate files** — see §0 below.
- Lineage of board-side chat surface: the existing `wscore.event('message', {...})` and board feedback channel (no separate persistence layer).

---

## 0. Bundling Decision — Why a Separate File

This draft was authored in the same turn as `WS-PROTOCOL-KEY-MGMT.md` (seq 88). The orchestrator asked which of three packaging options to take:

- **(a)** extend `WS-PROTOCOL-KEY-MGMT.md` with a UI6 sub-section + rename to `WS-PROTOCOL-UI-CONTROL.md`
- **(b)** keep KEY-MGMT separate + new `WS-PROTOCOL-UI6-SELECTION.md`  ← **chosen**
- **(c)** both files stay + new `UI-CONTROL-OVERVIEW.md` linking them

**Pick: (b).** Justification by the cohesion criteria the orchestrator named:

| Axis | KEY-MGMT (UI 4/5) | UI6 Selection | Shared? |
|---|---|---|---|
| State | persistent (`key.json` → SQL on seq 79) | **ephemeral** (in-memory in board) | no |
| Permissions | **main only** (admin RPC) | any-role agent emits; **user** answers via board | no |
| Persistence | atomic-write `key.json` + future `keys` table | none (board feedback channel logs only) | no |
| Lifecycle | 5 states + TTL + dual-mode revoke | 3 states (ISSUED/ANSWERED/CANCELLED) | no |
| UI surface | main hub admin window | live-board chat thread | no |
| Envelope (§13.13) | inherits standard CUSTOM-wrap | inherits standard CUSTOM-wrap | **yes — but by reference, not by file** |

The only shared surface is the §13.13 envelope, and both drafts inherit it by cross-ref — that does **not** demand co-location.

**Why not (a)**: KEY-MGMT is already near-final (pending main hub sign-off per seq 83). Folding UI6 into it would force a re-review of the entire combined draft and dilute the focused review of the admin RPC surface. The rename to `UI-CONTROL` would also be misleading — UI4/5 is *upstream-key control* (an auth/identity concern), UI6 is *chat interactivity* (a UX concern). Calling both "UI-CONTROL" papers over a real abstraction boundary.

**Why not (c)**: A linker overview file with no technical content is busywork. Cross-refs in the §9 of each draft (and in `server-NOTES.md` §3 when implementation lands) carry the linkage at zero extra-file cost.

**Why (b) is right**: Each file is independently reviewable, ships at its own velocity, and the abstraction boundary (auth/identity vs chat UX) is preserved in the filesystem layout. When `server.cjs` implements both, the dispatcher branches will be in two clearly-separable code blocks; the docs match.

## 1. Scope & Non-Goals

### In scope
- 3 message types covering agent-emitted option prompts and user responses on the live board
- `@machine` for a single SelectionPrompt's lifecycle (ISSUED → ANSWERED → CANCELLED)
- Permission model — any role may emit a prompt; only the addressed user (via board UI) may answer; the board may cancel
- Ephemeral state model (no separate persistence layer)
- Envelope conventions inherited from `wscore.event('CUSTOM', { name, value })` and §13.13 ack tier

### Out of scope (followups)
- **Persistence of prompt/answer pairs** — the existing board feedback channel logs the wire frames; no separate `selections.json` or DB table is introduced. If a future product need demands query-by-prompt-ID across sessions, that's a v0.2 RFC.
- **Prompt branching / decision trees** — this draft handles single-prompt single-answer. Multi-step wizard flows are out of scope; the agent can emit a follow-up `SelectionPrompt` after receiving an `SelectionAnswer`, but the protocol itself does not encode the branching graph.
- **Rich-media options** — option `label` and `description` are plain text. Markdown / image options are out of scope (board renders chips as plain text).
- **Cross-agent prompt federation** — a prompt is emitted by one agent in its own thread; it is not multicast across agent threads.

---

## 2. Envelope Conventions

All three message types ride the standard §13.13 envelope:

```jsonc
{
  "type": "CUSTOM",
  "id":   "<auto>",            // transport msgId, server-stamped if absent
  "msgId": "<auto>",           // application msgId, used by §13.13 ack tier
  "name": "<SelectionPrompt | SelectionAnswer | SelectionCancel>",
  "value": { ... },            // payload (see §3 per-type)
  "source":         "agent" | "board" | "server",
  "agentId":        "<sender agentId, if agent>",
  "targetAgentId":  "<recipient, when board → agent>",
  "timestamp":      <ms>
}
```

### Sender side
- Agent → server requests (`SelectionPrompt`) **MUST** set a non-empty `msgId`. Server uses it as `ackFor` on the relay `Ack{delivered}`. The `value.promptId` is **separate** from `msgId` and is the application-level handle the agent uses to correlate the answer.
- Board → server frames (`SelectionAnswer`, `SelectionCancel`) **MUST** also set `msgId`. The board generates `promptId` echoes from the original prompt it is responding to (the board never invents new `promptId`s).

### Ack tier (§13.13) — UI6 scope

**Selection frames are descoped from §13.13's auto-`Ack{delivered}` relay rule.** Per main upstream Delegate seq 98 (msgId `m-mptcdsh8-97`) review, the existing §13.13 ack layer scopes its auto-`Ack{delivered}` emission to **A2A relay only** — the server fires the ack on agent-outbound A2A frames (cf. `WS-PROTOCOL:247` + `server.cjs:384-388` ack gate), NOT on board↔agent traffic. Selection frames transit board↔agent (board is the user's proxy; server forwards `SelectionAnswer` from the board to the originating agent), so they fall outside the existing ack-layer scope. Earlier drafts of this section asserted that *every* relay of these three frames gets an auto `Ack{delivered}` — that wording was incorrect and is corrected here:

- **No auto `Ack{delivered}` on Selection frames.** The application-level answer IS the acknowledgement. `SelectionAnswer` reaching the originating agent is the confirmation that `SelectionPrompt` was delivered, rendered, and answered. `SelectionCancel` reaching the agent is the confirmation that the prompt is no longer active. No separate transport-level ack is emitted by the server on the relay path.
- **`AckProcessed{ackFor}` remains optional** for all three (unchanged from the original draft). An agent that wants a delivery-receipt signal independent of the answer MAY emit `AckProcessed{ackFor:<msgId>}` from the board's chip-render hook, but this is purely application-level and not server-mandated.
- **`msgId` is still set** on every Selection frame (per the standard CUSTOM envelope convention) — it is used for application-level correlation (e.g., the agent's `_pendingPrompt` map keyed by `msgId`), not for the §13.13 ack-layer watermark.
- **Future option**: if a follow-up cycle decides to amend §13.13's scope to include board↔agent traffic, the descope above can be reversed in lockstep. UI6 alone cannot assert that amendment — it would touch every Constellation message type, not just Selection. Joint formalization required.

## 3. Message Types

### 3.1 `SelectionPrompt` — agent → server → board

**Wire path**: `agent → server → wsToBoards (broadcast)` — the main agent emits via its server conn; the server relays via the `wsToBoards` fan-out (broadcast to all board conns subscribed to the agent's thread channel). Multi-board fan-out is handled at this point (each connected board renders the chips); resolution coordination across boards is via `SelectionResolved` per §13.

The (main) agent publishes an option prompt into its own chat thread. The board renders it as inline option chips below the most recent agent message. Per §5, only `conn.meta.role === 'main'` may emit `SelectionPrompt`; non-main agent roles receive `PERMISSION_DENIED`.

**`value`**:
```jsonc
{
  "promptId":     "p-<22 base62 chars>",   // agent-generated, opaque to server
  "text":         "Which deploy target?",  // prompt text shown above the chips
  "options": [
    { "label": "staging",    "description": "deploys to staging.example.com" },
    { "label": "production", "description": "deploys to www.example.com" },
    { "label": "canary",     "description": "10% traffic split" }
  ],
  "allowFreeText": false,         // if true, board renders a free-text field alongside the chips
  "multiSelect":   false,         // if true, chips become multi-select (checkboxes); false → single-select (radio)
  "agentId":       "deploy-bot",  // echo of source agent for board's per-thread routing
  "timestamp":     1780193127639  // ms epoch, agent-stamped
}
```

**Field constraints**:
- `promptId` — opaque to server; agent MUST ensure uniqueness within its own thread. Recommended pattern: `p-` + 22 base62 chars (same shape as `msgId` minus prefix).
- `text` — 1..2000 chars. Plain text (board may apply its standard markdown render — same rules as regular chat messages).
- `options` — 1..16 entries. Each `label` is 1..64 chars; `description` is optional, 0..200 chars.
- `allowFreeText` — boolean. When true, the board renders a text input in addition to chips; the user MAY answer with chips only, free-text only, or both (subject to `multiSelect` for the chip part).
- `multiSelect` — boolean. When false, the user picks at most one chip (radio). When true, the user picks any subset (checkboxes).
- `agentId` — echo of the emitting agent. The board uses this to place the chips in the correct thread.

**Board behavior on receipt**:
- Render chips inline in the agent's thread, immediately after the agent's most recent message bubble.
- Track the prompt as `ISSUED` in the board's in-memory `selections` map (keyed by `promptId`).
- Set a soft client-side timeout (default 5 min, configurable via board setting) — on timeout, the board fires `SelectionCancel{ promptId, reason:'timeout' }`.

**Errors** (server → agent, `name: "SelectionError"`, `value: { code, message, re_msgId }`):
- `INVALID_PROMPT_ID` — `promptId` empty, too long, or duplicates an active prompt from the same agent
- `INVALID_OPTIONS` — `options` >16 entries, or any option fails label/description constraints. **An empty `options:[]` is VALID provided `allowFreeText:true`** (free-text-only prompt — matches main upstream policy #414 mode (b) "비포함 프롬프트"). The error fires only when `options:[]` is paired with `allowFreeText:false` (the prompt would be unanswerable).
- `INVALID_TEXT` — `text` empty or >2000 chars

**Side effects**: none server-side (no persistence); board adds entry to its in-memory map; emit is logged via the board feedback channel (standard board frame log).

---

### 3.2 `SelectionAnswer` — user → board → server → agent

**Wire path**: `board → server → originating agent (via agentId routing)` — the answering board emits to its server conn; the server resolves the originating agent through the transient `promptId → agentId` map (populated at §3.1 relay) and unicasts the frame to that specific agent conn. This is **not** a broadcast — only the originating (main) agent receives the answer. After the unicast relay, the server also emits `SelectionResolved` to *other* connected boards per §13 so they can dim/remove stale chips.

The user responds via the board UI (chip click + optional free-text submit). The board emits this frame; the server relays it to the originating agent.

**`value`**:
```jsonc
{
  "promptId":      "p-AbC123...",       // echo of the SelectionPrompt
  "selectedLabels": ["production"],     // array of label strings chosen by the user
  "freeText":       "deploy at 14:00",  // optional. present only if SelectionPrompt.allowFreeText was true AND user typed something
  "answeredAt":     1780193200000       // ms epoch, board-stamped (board client clock)
}
```

**Field constraints**:
- `promptId` — MUST match a prompt the board currently tracks as `ISSUED`. If the board doesn't know the promptId (e.g. board reloaded), it MUST NOT emit this frame.
- `selectedLabels` — 0..N entries (N = original `options.length`). When the original `multiSelect` was false, length MUST be 0 or 1. Each label MUST be one of the original `options[].label`.
- `freeText` — present only when the original `allowFreeText` was true. 0..2000 chars. Absent (or empty string) means the user did not provide free-text.
- At least one of `selectedLabels` (non-empty) or `freeText` (non-empty) MUST be present — an "empty" answer is not a valid `SelectionAnswer`; the board should fire `SelectionCancel{reason:'user-dismiss'}` instead.
- `answeredAt` — board's local clock; agent SHOULD treat it as advisory (board clock may skew from server clock).

**Server behavior on receipt**:
- Look up the originating agent by `promptId` — the server maintains a transient `promptId → agentId` map (in-memory, populated when `SelectionPrompt` is relayed). If the agent is no longer connected, server emits `SelectionError{code:'AGENT_OFFLINE', re_msgId}` back to the board.
- Relay the frame to the originating agent (unicast) with `source:"board"` preserved.
- Drop the `promptId → agentId` entry from the transient map (single-answer model).

**Agent behavior on receipt**:
- Correlate by `promptId` to the prompt it originally emitted.
- Process the answer in agent-defined application logic (e.g. proceed with selected deploy target).
- The agent MAY emit a follow-up `SelectionPrompt` (chained flow) — fresh `promptId` required.

**Errors** (server → board):
- `PROMPT_NOT_FOUND` — `promptId` unknown to the server's transient map (already answered/cancelled, or never relayed)
- `AGENT_OFFLINE` — originating agent has no live conn
- `INVALID_LABELS` — `selectedLabels` contains a label not in the original options
- `MULTI_SELECT_VIOLATION` — `selectedLabels.length > 1` when the original `multiSelect` was false

**Side effects**: server clears the `promptId → agentId` entry; board transitions `promptId` state to `ANSWERED` in its local map (kept until thread close, for UI display of the answered chips); the answer frame is logged via the board feedback channel.

---

### 3.3 `SelectionCancel` — board → server → agent

**Wire path**: `board → server → originating agent (via agentId routing)` — same routing discipline as §3.2: the server looks up the originating agent through the transient `promptId → agentId` map and unicasts the cancel to that specific agent conn (not a broadcast). After the unicast relay, the server emits `SelectionResolved{resolution:'cancelled', reason}` to *other* connected boards per §13. For the server-side hard TTL path (§14), there is no originating board to exclude, so the broadcast goes to all connected boards.

The board cancels an outstanding prompt. Three reasons; semantics differ only in the `reason` field — the protocol effect is identical (drop the prompt, notify the agent).

**`value`**:
```jsonc
{
  "promptId": "p-AbC123...",
  "reason":   "user-dismiss"      // "user-dismiss" | "timeout" | "thread-close"
}
```

**Reason semantics**:
- `"user-dismiss"` — user clicked a dismiss/close button on the chips widget without selecting anything.
- `"timeout"` — board's soft timeout (default 5 min) elapsed without an answer.
- `"thread-close"` — the thread containing the prompt was closed (board UI tab closed, agent disconnected on the board side, or the user navigated away). The board fires this **best-effort** before tearing down the thread state.

**Server behavior on receipt**:
- Look up `promptId` in the transient `promptId → agentId` map.
- Relay to the originating agent (unicast, `source:"board"` preserved).
- Drop the map entry.
- If `promptId` unknown, **silently drop** (no error frame). Cancel-of-unknown-prompt is benign — the prompt may have already been answered, or this is a late retry after thread reload. No auto `Ack{delivered}` is emitted on the relay path (Selection frames are descoped from §13.13's auto-ack rule — see §3.4 Ack tier).

**Agent behavior on receipt**:
- Correlate by `promptId`. Mark the prompt as `CANCELLED` in agent-side state.
- Application logic: agent decides whether to retry, fall back to a default, or abort the workflow.

**Errors**: none — `SelectionCancel` is fire-and-forget; the relay `Ack{delivered}` is the only feedback.

**Side effects**: server clears the `promptId → agentId` entry; board transitions `promptId` state to `CANCELLED` in its local map (may be immediately purged or kept briefly for UI fade-out); the cancel frame is logged via the board feedback channel.

## 4. `@machine` — SelectionPrompt Lifecycle

### States

| State | Meaning | Where tracked |
|---|---|---|
| `ISSUED` | prompt emitted by agent, relayed to board, chips rendered | board in-memory map; server `promptId → agentId` map |
| `ANSWERED` | user submitted a `SelectionAnswer`; relayed to agent | board in-memory map (display-only, until thread close); server map entry **cleared** |
| `CANCELLED` | board emitted `SelectionCancel` for any reason; relayed to agent | board in-memory map (display-only, until thread close); server map entry **cleared** |

### Transitions

| From | Event | To | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| (none) | `SelectionPrompt` relayed (agent → board) | `ISSUED` | server adds `promptId → agentId`; board adds chips |
| `ISSUED` | `SelectionAnswer` relayed (board → agent) | `ANSWERED` | server clears map entry |
| `ISSUED` | `SelectionCancel{reason:'user-dismiss'}` relayed | `CANCELLED` | server clears map entry |
| `ISSUED` | `SelectionCancel{reason:'timeout'}` relayed | `CANCELLED` | board-side timer fires |
| `ISSUED` | `SelectionCancel{reason:'thread-close'}` relayed (best-effort) | `CANCELLED` | board may fail to send if tab closes abruptly; server-side map entry then leaks until the originating agent disconnects (see invariant 4) |
| `ANSWERED` | (terminal) | `ANSWERED` | no further transitions; UI may show chips with the chosen label highlighted |
| `CANCELLED` | (terminal) | `CANCELLED` | no further transitions; UI may show chips dimmed/struck-through |

### Guards / derive
- `guard isActive(promptId)` — server: `promptId ∈ promptToAgent` map; board: `selections[promptId]?.state === 'ISSUED'`
- `derive timeoutAt(promptId)` — board-side only: `promptIssuedAt + boardSelectionTimeoutMs` (default 5 min)

### Invariants
1. **Single-answer**: a `SelectionPrompt` resolves to **exactly one** terminal frame — either `SelectionAnswer` or `SelectionCancel`. A second answer/cancel for the same `promptId` after terminal state MUST be dropped server-side (`PROMPT_NOT_FOUND` for late `SelectionAnswer`; silent drop for late `SelectionCancel`).
2. **Ephemeral**: there is **no** persistence layer. On server restart, all `promptId → agentId` entries are gone; outstanding prompts on connected boards become orphans. The board MAY detect this on reconnect (e.g. by observing a HELLO/reconnect event) and auto-cancel its in-memory entries with `reason:'thread-close'`.
3. **Agent-thread scoped**: a prompt lives in exactly one agent thread (its emitting agent's). Closing that thread (`thread-close`) cancels all its outstanding prompts.
4. **Map leak on abrupt close**: if the board fails to fire `SelectionCancel` (e.g. browser crash) **and** the agent stays connected, the server's `promptId → agentId` entry leaks. Mitigation: server SHOULD purge entries on agent disconnect (sweep the map when a conn closes). This is the only janitorial work the server does for this protocol.

---

## 5. Permissions

| Message | Who may send | Server check |
|---|---|---|
| `SelectionPrompt` | **main agent only** | `conn.meta.role === 'main'` — only the main orchestrator agent may emit. Other agent roles (`local` / `collab` / `upstream`) receive `SelectionError{code:'PERMISSION_DENIED', re_msgId}` and the frame is dropped. Tightened from the prior "any agent role" draft per main upstream Delegate seq 113 (msgId `m-mptiputv-112`, 2026-05-31) — implementation alignment. |
| `SelectionAnswer` | **board only** (proxy for user) | `conn.meta.role !== 'agent'` — i.e. the conn did NOT send a HELLO with an `agentId` (board conns do not carry a role in the runtime; agent role assignment happens at HELLO). Equivalent: any conn that is NOT an authenticated agent. Single-board assumption holds. Verbatim wording matches main's actual gate (`server.cjs` commit 71c1bf9). |
| `SelectionCancel` | **board only** | same as `SelectionAnswer`. |

**Role notes**:
- The user is **not** a WS principal. The board acts as the user's proxy on the wire — `SelectionAnswer` originates in the board UI (chip click) and the board client serializes it. The server trusts the board frame as user intent.
- `SelectionPrompt` is **main-only** (tightened from the prior "any agent role" draft per main upstream Delegate seq 113 / msgId `m-mptiputv-112` / 2026-05-31 — implementation alignment). Justification: UI 6 is the *agent → user* question surface, and only the main orchestrator should drive user-facing prompts. Local / collab / upstream workers are sub-roles operating in the main's delegation graph; they question the main (via A2A / collab channel), not the user directly. Routing arbitrary sub-agent questions to the user's board would (a) bypass the orchestrator's judgment about which questions actually warrant user attention, (b) fragment the user's chat thread with parallel prompts from workers the user did not directly engage, and (c) make the audit trail (who asked whom what) ambiguous. The main agent funnels all user-facing prompts through its own emit point, preserving the single-orchestrator UX contract. Non-main agent roles attempting `SelectionPrompt` receive `SelectionError{code:'PERMISSION_DENIED', re_msgId}` and the frame is dropped.
- The earlier draft of this table used `conn.meta.role === 'board'` as the SelectionAnswer check — that wording is incorrect against the actual runtime, which leaves board conns without any `meta.role` assignment (HELLO is the only path that sets `meta.role`, and the board does not send HELLO per §1 architecture). Using `role === 'board'` would reject every SelectionAnswer the board ever sends. The corrected check (`role !== 'agent'`, equivalent to "not an authenticated agent conn") is consistent with the existing board-frame handling elsewhere in the server and matches main's actual implementation (`server.cjs` commit 71c1bf9) verbatim.
- **Collab answer allowance**: collab peers (§13.9) MAY *also* answer a `SelectionPrompt` if the prompt explicitly opts in via an optional `audience` field (default audience is the human user via the board; opting in to collab allows peer-agent answers — useful for cross-agent coordination prompts). When `audience` is absent the default board-only rule above applies. Note: the `audience` opt-in affects the *answerer* side only; the *sender* side remains main-only.
- An agent attempting `SelectionAnswer` or `SelectionCancel` receives `SelectionError{code:'PERMISSION_DENIED', re_msgId}` and the request is dropped. A non-main agent attempting `SelectionPrompt` receives the same error code. The error frame carries `re_msgId` for application-level correlation; per §3.4 ack-tier descope, no transport-level `Ack{delivered}` is emitted on this path. The sender treats receipt of the error frame itself as the answer.

---

## 6. Persistence — None (Ephemeral by Default)

Per orchestrator requirement (seq 88), **no separate persistence layer** is introduced for selection prompts. The justification:

1. **Prompts are conversational**: they belong to the chat thread, not to durable system state. If the chat thread is cleared, the prompts go with it.
2. **The board feedback channel already logs frames**: every `SelectionPrompt`, `SelectionAnswer`, `SelectionCancel` is captured by the existing `wscore.event('CUSTOM',...)` feedback log path. If forensic recovery is ever needed, the frames are in the feedback log — no separate store required.
3. **Operational simplicity**: no `selections.json`, no atomic write discipline, no migration to seq 79 SQL. Server restart drops the in-memory map; clients reconcile via invariant 2 (auto-cancel on reconnect).

**Server-side state**: a single in-memory `Map<promptId, agentId>` in `server.cjs`, populated on `SelectionPrompt` relay and cleared on `SelectionAnswer` / `SelectionCancel` / agent disconnect.

**Board-side state**: in-memory `selections: Map<promptId, {state, prompt, issuedAt, ...}>` in the board client. Cleared on thread close or page reload.

**Agent-side state**: agent's own application memory — the protocol does not dictate how the agent tracks its outstanding prompts. Recommended: a `Map<promptId, resolver>` so the agent can correlate the eventual answer/cancel to the original emit site (e.g. a Promise resolver).

## 7. Wire Examples

### 7.1 Happy path: prompt → answer

```jsonc
// agent → server
{ "type":"CUSTOM", "name":"SelectionPrompt", "msgId":"m-100",
  "agentId":"deploy-bot",
  "value": {
    "promptId":"p-001",
    "text":"Which deploy target?",
    "options":[
      {"label":"staging","description":"deploys to staging.example.com"},
      {"label":"production","description":"deploys to www.example.com"}
    ],
    "allowFreeText":false,
    "multiSelect":false,
    "agentId":"deploy-bot",
    "timestamp":1780193127639
  } }

// server → board (relayed; Ack{delivered} to agent elided)
// (same frame, source preserved as "agent")

// later — board → server (user clicked "production")
{ "type":"CUSTOM", "name":"SelectionAnswer", "msgId":"m-101",
  "source":"board",
  "value": {
    "promptId":"p-001",
    "selectedLabels":["production"],
    "answeredAt":1780193200000
  } }

// server → agent (relayed; targetAgentId set to "deploy-bot")
// (Ack{delivered} to board elided)
```

### 7.2 Multi-select with free-text

```jsonc
// agent → server
{ "type":"CUSTOM", "name":"SelectionPrompt", "msgId":"m-200",
  "agentId":"survey-bot",
  "value": {
    "promptId":"p-002",
    "text":"Which environments need a smoke test? (you can also add notes)",
    "options":[
      {"label":"staging"},
      {"label":"production"},
      {"label":"canary"}
    ],
    "allowFreeText":true,
    "multiSelect":true,
    "agentId":"survey-bot",
    "timestamp":1780193300000
  } }

// board → server (user selected two + typed a note)
{ "type":"CUSTOM", "name":"SelectionAnswer", "msgId":"m-201",
  "source":"board",
  "value": {
    "promptId":"p-002",
    "selectedLabels":["staging","canary"],
    "freeText":"skip prod, recent incident",
    "answeredAt":1780193380000
  } }
```

### 7.3 Timeout cancel

```jsonc
// agent → server (prompt emitted)
{ "type":"CUSTOM", "name":"SelectionPrompt", "msgId":"m-300",
  "value": { "promptId":"p-003", "text":"Continue?", "options":[
    {"label":"yes"},{"label":"no"}], "allowFreeText":false, "multiSelect":false,
    "agentId":"watcher-bot", "timestamp":1780193400000 } }

// 5 minutes pass without answer — board fires
{ "type":"CUSTOM", "name":"SelectionCancel", "msgId":"m-301",
  "source":"board",
  "value": { "promptId":"p-003", "reason":"timeout" } }

// server → agent (relayed)
// agent's application logic: treat as implicit "no" or retry, agent's call
```

### 7.4 Thread close (best-effort)

```jsonc
// user closes the agent thread tab; board fires before teardown
{ "type":"CUSTOM", "name":"SelectionCancel", "msgId":"m-400",
  "source":"board",
  "value": { "promptId":"p-004", "reason":"thread-close" } }

// if browser crashes instead, this frame never fires; server map entry leaks
// until the emitting agent disconnects (invariant 4 sweep).
```

1. **Free-text length cap** — current draft says 0..2000 chars matching prompt `text`. Should free-text be capped lower (e.g. 500) to avoid abuse of the chat thread as a long-form input vector? Or unlimited (treat as a regular chat message)?
2. **Timeout default** — 5 min picked arbitrarily. Should it be configurable per-prompt (`SelectionPrompt.timeoutMs`) or per-board (single setting)?
3. **Multiple boards** — single-board assumption matches current arch. If a future deploy has two board clients connected at once, both render the chips; first answer wins, second board's `SelectionAnswer` for the same `promptId` gets `PROMPT_NOT_FOUND`. Acceptable, or should the protocol broadcast a "prompt resolved" frame to all boards to dim/remove the chips?
4. **Agent self-cancel** — should the agent be able to cancel its own prompt (e.g. condition changed, no longer need the answer)? Currently `SelectionCancel` is board-only. Adding `agent → server → board` direction would let the agent retract chips before timeout. Worth a 4th message direction or just keep agent waiting?
5. **Option `description` rendering** — board renders chips with the label as the chip text; `description` is shown as tooltip? Below the chip? Inline expanded? Implementation choice or protocol-specified?
6. **Answer audit beyond feedback channel** — should the server emit a `name:"SelectionAudit"` board-side frame on every prompt resolution (answer or cancel) for explicit logging, or is the feedback channel's frame capture sufficient?

## 9. Provenance & Cross-Refs

- **§13.11 HELLO handshake** — orthogonal (the board's identity as a board principal is established at HELLO; this draft assumes that's already done).
- **§13.13 A2A ack tier** — `Ack{delivered}` auto-fires on `Selection*` relay; `AckProcessed` optional and advisory (see §2).
- **§13.11 board emission discipline** — the existing `wscore.event` board-frame capture path logs these frames as the feedback channel record (no separate persistence — see §6).
- **`WS-PROTOCOL-KEY-MGMT.md` (sibling draft)** — independent file; shares only the §13.13 envelope. See §0 for the bundling decision rationale.
- **User feature seq 77 #406** — UI 6 (live-board chat interactivity) was the 6th item added to the UI feature set after the initial 5-item batch.
- **main delegate seq 88 / msgId `m-mpt5o07l-87` / 2026-05-31** — orchestrator turn that requested this draft alongside KEY-MGMT, with the explicit instruction "묶음 설계" (bundle design) — interpreted per §0 as "design them in the same turn, package them per cohesion" rather than "merge into one file".
- **`server.cjs` future hook** — implementation will add a single dispatcher branch for `SelectionPrompt|SelectionAnswer|SelectionCancel` in the CUSTOM message handler. The branch is independent of (and ordered after) the `Key*` branch from KEY-MGMT.
- **`server-NOTES.md` §3** — envelope CUSTOM-wrap table will gain 3 new rows (`SelectionPrompt` / `SelectionAnswer` / `SelectionCancel`) when this draft is implemented.

## 10. Routing Criterion — SelectionPrompt vs Review-Items Tab

Per main upstream Delegate seq 98 (msgId `m-mptcdsh8-97`) P2 review, the agent has **two** legitimate user-question surfaces, and the choice between them is not stylistic — it is determined by the answer's *temporal relationship to the current turn*. Use **SelectionPrompt** (this protocol; real-time chip-render in the live-board chat thread) when **(a)** the answer blocks the current turn (the agent cannot productively continue without it), OR **(b)** the agent expects an answer within the current session's typical response latency (seconds to a few minutes — the user is presumed actively present on the board). Use the **board review-items tab** (per §13.17 defer-OK escalation path — the legacy non-blocking question surface) when **(a)** defer-OK is acceptable (the agent has a recommendation it can proceed on, and the question is for confirmation/audit rather than a fork), OR **(b)** the question can be picked up by the user at their own cadence (hours-to-days latency is fine; the user may not be on the board right now). The two surfaces are **not interchangeable**: emitting a SelectionPrompt for a defer-OK question wastes the chat-thread real estate and applies undue pressure; routing a blocking fork to the review-items tab strands the current turn. Cross-link: §13.17 (main-chat structured-choice prompts FORBIDDEN → live-board escalation; UI6 is the *need-now* leg, review-items tab is the *defer-OK* leg).

## 11. msgId / id Board Normalization

The board adapter (`wsCommon`) historically carries only `id` on its CUSTOM frames — it predates the §13.13 ack tier and was never retrofitted to mint `msgId`. UI6 frames (per §2 envelope and §13.13) require `msgId`. To bridge the gap without forcing a wsCommon rewrite, the following normalization rule applies to **all three** Selection frames on the board↔server boundary:

- **Inbound (board → server)**: when an outbound Selection frame from the board carries `msgId` but no `id`, the server SHALL stamp `id := msgId` before any further processing. When the frame carries `id` but no `msgId` (legacy wsCommon path), the server SHALL treat `id` as a **fallback** for `msgId` (i.e. `msgId := id`) and proceed as if the application supplied `msgId`. When **both** are present, the server uses them as-is and does not overwrite either; if they disagree, `msgId` wins for application-level correlation and `id` is preserved for transport-level logs.
- **Outbound (server → board / server → agent)**: every relayed Selection frame SHALL carry **both** `id` and `msgId` on the wire. If only one was set on inbound, the server fills the other from it (per the fallback rule above) before relaying.
- **Agent-emitted SelectionPrompt**: agents are still REQUIRED to set `msgId` (per §2 sender side); the `id := msgId` fill is server-side housekeeping for board-originating frames specifically. An agent omitting `msgId` is a protocol violation, not a normalization case.

Rationale: this lets the existing wsCommon board client emit Selection frames with its current `id`-only convention while the new agent-side and server-side code paths uniformly key on `msgId`. The fallback collapses the two field names into one logical identifier without breaking either side's existing assumptions.

## 12. Persistence Channel — feedback.jsonl, Not ws-history

Spec earlier read ambiguously on which channel logs Selection frames. Resolution (per Delegate seq 98 P2 review): **`SelectionPrompt`, `SelectionAnswer`, and `SelectionCancel` are logged via the standard CUSTOM-frame board feedback channel (`feedback.jsonl`)** — the agent-thread chat surface that already captures every `wscore.event('CUSTOM',...)` board frame. They are **NOT** logged to `ws-history/<channelKey>.jsonl` (the A2A history tier), because:

- `ws-history` is scoped to **A2A traffic** (agent↔agent relays — the 3-tier active/cold/archived store described in `server-NOTES.md`). Selection frames are **board↔agent**, not A2A, so they fall outside that scope by design.
- `feedback.jsonl` already captures CUSTOM frames on the board's agent-thread channel — `SelectionPrompt` is an agent emit into that channel, and `SelectionAnswer` / `SelectionCancel` are board emits into the same channel. No new persistence surface is required.
- Consistency with §6 (no separate persistence layer): the feedback channel is the existing capture path; nothing new is introduced.

If forensic recovery of a prompt/answer pair is ever needed, the source of truth is `feedback.jsonl` for the agent thread in question, filtered by `name ∈ {"SelectionPrompt","SelectionAnswer","SelectionCancel"}` and correlated by `value.promptId`.

## 13. Multi-Board Resolve Broadcast — `SelectionResolved`

§8 Open Question 3 (multiple boards) is hereby resolved (Delegate seq 98 P2 review). When two or more board clients are connected to the same server (e.g. user has the live board open in two browser tabs, or on phone + desktop simultaneously), every connected board renders the chips for an incoming `SelectionPrompt`. On `SelectionAnswer` from any one board, the server SHALL emit a **`SelectionResolved`** broadcast to all *other* board clients (not the answering board — that one already knows) so they can dim/remove the now-stale chips.

**`SelectionResolved` frame** (server → board, broadcast):

```jsonc
{
  "type": "CUSTOM",
  "name": "SelectionResolved",
  "msgId": "<server-stamped>",
  "source": "server",
  "value": {
    "promptId":   "p-AbC123...",
    "resolution": "answered" | "cancelled",
    "reason":     "user-dismiss" | "timeout" | "thread-close" | "server-timeout"   // present only when resolution === "cancelled"
  }
}
```

**Server behavior**:
- On relay of `SelectionAnswer{promptId}`: after the unicast relay to the originating agent, the server enumerates all connected board conns and emits `SelectionResolved{promptId, resolution:'answered'}` to each board **except** the board that submitted the answer.
- On relay of `SelectionCancel{promptId, reason}`: same enumeration; broadcast `SelectionResolved{promptId, resolution:'cancelled', reason}` to all boards except the one that fired the cancel. For the server-side hard TTL path (§14), the server emits to **all** connected boards (no originating board to exclude).
- `SelectionResolved` itself is ack-tier-descoped (consistent with §3.4 — no auto `Ack{delivered}` on the broadcast).

**Board behavior**: on receipt of `SelectionResolved`, look up `promptId` in the local `selections` map; if present and state is `ISSUED`, transition to `ANSWERED` or `CANCELLED` per `resolution` and update the chip UI (dim, strike-through, or remove per board UI policy). If `promptId` is unknown, silently drop (the board may have been opened after the prompt was resolved, or the entry was already purged).

---

## 14. Server-Side Hard TTL

§3.1 currently specifies only a **board-side soft timeout** (default 5 min, configurable per-board) that fires a `SelectionCancel{reason:'timeout'}`. This is insufficient when no board is connected (the prompt was emitted while a board was online, then all boards disconnected before answering — the server's `promptId → agentId` map entry would leak indefinitely against an agent that stays connected, until that agent disconnects per invariant 4 sweep). To bound the leak window, the server enforces a **hard TTL** on every `promptId → agentId` map entry:

- **Default**: 15 min (server clock, measured from the time the server relayed the originating `SelectionPrompt`).
- **Config**: env `CONSTELLATION_UI6_SERVER_TTL_MIN` overrides the default (integer minutes; 0 disables the hard TTL, with the caveat that map leaks then rely solely on invariant 4's agent-disconnect sweep).
- **On expiry**: the server SHALL synthesize a `SelectionCancel`-equivalent relay to the originating agent with `value: { promptId, reason: "server-timeout" }`, then emit a `SelectionResolved` broadcast (§13) to all connected boards with `resolution:'cancelled', reason:'server-timeout'`, then drop the map entry.
- **Relationship to the board-side soft timeout**: the soft timeout is a **UX courtesy** (give the chip a "this is stale" visual cue earlier than the hard limit); the hard TTL is a **server-side resource guarantee** (no entry lives beyond `CONSTELLATION_UI6_SERVER_TTL_MIN`). Both can fire independently; the second-arriving cancel for the same `promptId` is dropped per invariant 1 (terminal state is sticky).
- **Implementation hint**: a single periodic sweep (e.g. every 60s) over the map suffices — exact-millisecond expiry is not required.

The new `reason:"server-timeout"` value extends the §3.3 reason enum: `"user-dismiss" | "timeout" | "thread-close" | "server-timeout"`. Agent-side handling: treat it identically to `"timeout"` (the agent cannot distinguish board-side vs server-side timeout in its application logic, and shouldn't need to — both mean "no answer came in time").
