# /subscaler — tiered model composition

`/superscalar` decides **how eagerly** to fan out. This skill decides **what each lane runs on** — tier *and* effort. The two are orthogonal; set them independently.

The mechanism that makes a tier drop safe is **spec completion before offload**: a fully-specified lane loses little from one tier down, an underspecified one loses a lot. Spec completeness is the quality moderator, not model size.

## Toggle contract

- State = **one marker file**: `.agent/subscaler.json` — `{"on": true, "family": "<vendor>", "effort": "<level>"}`. Read at invocation time; never mirror the state into other settings surfaces (duplicated per-role model bindings have shipped state-convergence bugs).
- `/subscaler on` writes it · `/subscaler off` removes it (or sets `"on": false`) · `/subscaler status` reads it back and reports where it would apply next.
- **Default OFF.** ON is recommended where fan-out has *already* forfeited the shared prompt cache. A delegated subagent starts cache-cold on its own model, so a small, cache-hot, deep-context edit loses money on delegation.

## Step 0 — frontier-main cost gate (when the orchestrator itself is T1)

If the main conversation runs on a T1 model (a Fable-class flagship), **inheritance is the failure mode**: the Agent tool resolves a subagent's model as per-invocation `model` → frontmatter `model` → `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` (a default, not a pin, since v2.1.251 — before that the env var came first) → *the main model*, and a Workflow `agent()` that omits `opts.model` inherits the same way. Nothing in that chain says "frontier" — it just is. Two env facts sit outside the chain: `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL_FORCE=1` (v2.1.257+) overrides every binding including the ones you wrote, and under a Fable main the built-in Explore agent's model depends on the connection — with a Claude subscription, a Console account or an `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` gateway it runs on whatever the `opus` alias resolves to (currently Opus 5.5), on other providers it stays on the main model (registry `harnessBinding`) — neither is visible from the spawn request, so verify with `/tasks` (v2.1.242+), which names each running subagent's model and effort. And every unbound lane inherits the session's effort level; `ultracode` is not a level — since v2.1.284 it is a toggle that stays on at whatever level the session runs (only `--effort ultracode` also sets `xhigh`). So, before any fan-out on a T1 main:

- **Delegate by default.** Anything below T1 in the Step 2 table leaves the main model — research, collection, mechanical edits, test authoring, summarization — as subagents or Workflow lanes on their own tier. The main model keeps only what Step 2 says to retain.
- **Bind every lane explicitly — model AND effort.** `model: "sonnet"` (or `"haiku"`) for exploration/collection/mechanical work at `low`–`medium`; `model: "opus"` for adversarial verification and judgment at `high`; `model: "fable"` **only** for a lane whose failure cost justifies T1 — architecture, ambiguous-requirement interpretation, final adversarial review — and name that reason in the lane label. Omitting `model` is not "let the harness choose"; it is choosing the most expensive option silently. Aliases resolve per provider and per harness version — `"haiku"` does not name the same model everywhere — so read the registry's `harnessBinding` alias table before binding by alias, and the resolved model's own row (`models[]`: window, price steps, refusal behaviour, minimum harness version) before trusting what it costs.
- **Never let T1 × `xhigh`|`max` exist by inheritance.** A Fable lane that sets no effort runs at the session's level. Bind it per lane: the Agent tool takes an `effort` parameter since Claude Code 2.1.292 (its precedence against subagent frontmatter `effort` and `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` is not documented — frontmatter is documented to lose to that variable, so don't count on a per-call value beating it), the subagent definition can set `effort`, or use a Workflow `agent()` with `opts.effort`. If a T1 lane genuinely needs the top rung, say so in the script (`// lane-model-guard: allow-fable-xhigh`) or the prompt (`fable-xhigh-ok`).
- **Step down before stepping across, even on T1.** The vendor's own Fable 5.1 guidance is that `low` is often competitive with Opus/Sonnet on cost per task while scoring higher — so a lane that truly needs T1 usually needs it at `low`/`medium`, not at the top rung.

The reference mechanism is a PreToolUse guard on `Agent|Workflow` that reads the session model from the transcript and denies unbound lanes while the main is T1 — this plugin ships it as `reference/lane-model-guard.cjs` (not auto-wired: add it to your harness's hook settings; the file header shows the Claude Code stanza). A rule that lives only in this file is one compaction away from being forgotten — the 2026-08-02 measurement was two workflows, 24 agents, all inheriting the frontier model with the rule already written down.

## Step 1 — read the registry, don't recall it

`plugins/superscalar/model-registry.json` is the source of truth for anything perishable: which models occupy which tier, their exact `apiModelId`, context windows, prices, **the vendor's exact effort values**, per-plan availability, and per-harness binding keys. Read it before binding a lane.

Never bind a model id from memory. Model ladders move monthly; the registry carries `asOf`, a `confirmedBy` URL per row, and a `caveats` list of what stayed unverified. If the model you want isn't in `models[]`, it isn't confirmed — check `caveats[]` before using it.

**If `revisit.date` has passed**, say so in the turn and treat every price/availability claim as provisional. Re-research is scheduled work (the registry's `revisit.watchlist` names what to check), not something to improvise mid-task.

## Step 2 — route each lane: measurement first, the tier table otherwise

**Retain on the main model** regardless of what follows: architecture decisions · ambiguous-requirement interpretation · cross-cutting design · complex debugging · final review · deep shared-context coding (vendor guidance is explicit that shared-context coding fits multi-agent decomposition poorly). Every delegated lane carries **explicit acceptance criteria + a test gate** written by the orchestrator before dispatch. The §2 cost-benefit gate runs FIRST (spawn at all?); this skill only picks what the lanes that pass it run on. The §3.1 Hyperbrief interlock for write/deploy/send lanes is unchanged.

Then, for each delegated lane, in order (spec: Superscalar §5.1.5 «Selection order»):

1. **Aim and reference tier.** Find the lane's shape in the registry's `taskShapeRouting` and read its `benchAim` — a judgement mapping from shape to bench aim, not a measurement. A delegated lane that is diagnose-and-fix with a reproducing failing test, design-and-build from a written specification, or correctness-critical implementation with an adversarial suite maps to aim 4, 5 or 6 directly; a migration that changes a data schema maps to aim 3. The lane's **reference tier** is the tier the table below gives its shape (a lane mapped directly with no fitting row: T1.5). `benchAim: null`, a registry with no `measuredRouting` yet, or an aim with no entry in it (only aims some shape maps to are generated; the rest stay in the `fullGrid` file for a deliberate decision) → go to 6.
2. **Gate.** Does the lane carry acceptance criteria and a test gate that decides pass/fail the way a hidden suite does? No → go to 6. (The measurement is the price of a *verified* result; it does not transfer to a lane nobody verifies.)
3. **Candidates, then one per model, then the cheapest.** Read `measuredRouting.aims[]` for that aim. Its `rows` hold only marked rows — `rec` is `"star"` (★), `"hollow"` (☆) or `"only"` (the single row of a model measured at one effort, which counts as that model's choice); every measured cell, unmarked ones included, is in the file `fullGrid` names — `bench-cells.json`, relative to the registry file: its sibling, shipped in this plugin. Keep only rows **bindable in this harness**: in Claude Code, Agent/Workflow `model` binds Claude models only — a Codex, Grok Build or Antigravity row needs its own harness lane (e.g. a Bash lane running `codex exec`) with its own allowance, so name it in the turn as an option and do not pick it silently. Keep rows of models **in the reference tier**, with `reachRate` 1, an entitled account (Step 3) and allowance left. `rec` is per model, and one model can carry several ★ rows (its efforts inside the ~20% tie band), so marks do not choose between models: take each model's lowest-`trustCostUsd` ★ or `"only"` row as that model's candidate, then the lowest `trustCostUsd` across candidates; candidates within ~20% of it are a tie → `communityRank`. A model's ☆ row stands in for its ★ only when wall time is the binding constraint.
   - **One tier down — only if all three hold:** (a) the aim **separated models** — the aim has `notReached` entries (computed over the full grid), or some cell at that aim reached in fewer than all its runs (`reachRate` below 1 in `rows`, or an unmarked cell in `fullGrid`); if every combination reached, the rows are a price signal inside the reference tier, not a ceiling; (b) the lower-tier row is **not provisional** (n ≥ 3, `reachRate` 1); (c) the lower tier may do the lane's work — **T4 never authors code** (Superscalar §5.1.1), so a T4 row never takes a code-authoring lane; say in the turn that it was the cheapest, as a divergence finding. At most one tier down. Read (a) from the data at binding time: where every combination at an aim reached, that aim licenses no step-down, and a T3 row is eligible only where the table below already admits T3 (a mechanical edit whose files are each independently verifiable).
   - Never move a lane **up** a tier on a row's say-so: a measurement shows what reaching an aim cost, not untested capability.
4. **Resolve the id.** Bind by the id the registry row confirms, not by habit. In Claude Code the `haiku` alias currently resolves to the newest Haiku on the Anthropic API (from a minimum Claude Code version) and to an older Haiku on other providers — the registry's `harnessBinding` alias table says which model and which version, and the two have separate measured rows. If the alias resolves to a model other than the row's `apiModelId` (wrong provider, or a local Claude Code older than the version the alias needs), the row does not apply: bind the full id where the provider exposes it, or re-select.
5. **Caveats.** Read the chosen model's registry row before dispatch; a caveat that changes what the lane costs or whether it completes overrides the measurement. Kinds to look for: **no server-side fallback** when the model refuses (a refused lane stays refused — give security-adjacent code another route or handle the refusal); a price that **steps up past a prompt length** (a lane carrying a large context does not inherit the measured cost); thinking that cannot be turned off; a context window or per-response output cap the lane would exceed. A `provisional: true` row (n = 1), bound inside the reference tier, gets "provisional" in the lane label or record.
6. **Fall back to the table** for every lane that steps 1–5 did not resolve. The tier column is the default; rows marked *measured* take their model and effort from step 3 when it resolved.

Then Steps 3–4 (availability, binding keys) before dispatch.

| Lane shape | Tier | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture · design decisions · ambiguous requirements | **T1** frontier-reasoning | vendor default; step up only on observed failure |
| Adversarial verification / red-team | **T1**, deliberately a **different family** than the author | raised |
| Complex multi-step execution with residual judgment (daily-driver main loop, heavyweight implementation lanes) | **T1.5** frontier-execution — *measured: see `measuredRouting` aim 3* | vendor default (`medium` on Opus 5.5; `high` on Opus 5); don't raise effort to buy deliberation — pair with verification gates (check-first, test gates) |
| Spec-complete implementation | **T2** agentic-execution — *measured: see `measuredRouting` aim 2* | default, dropping a rung once evals hold |
| Mechanical multi-file edit / migration | **T2** (T3 if each file is independently verifiable) — *measured: see `measuredRouting` aim 1* | low–medium |
| Test authoring | **T2** | medium; raise when tests must infer intent |
| Long-context review | **T2** on a large-window model | medium — window and price bind, not depth |
| Read-only exploration / search | **T3** bulk-worker | low |
| Summarization / extraction | **T3** (T4 if the output schema is fixed) | low, or none/minimal where offered |
| Resident board / inbox watching | **T4** resident-observer | minimal/none |

**Choosing inside a tier** (lanes that reached step 6): its harness still has **allowance** left → the registry's `communityRank` as the **tie-break only**. The rank is aggregated community sentiment — never the reason a lane lands on a model by itself; if it disagrees sharply with measured data, say so in the turn (that divergence is a finding). `communityRank.divergence[]` lists the divergences flagged at the sweep; an entry whose `benchSnapshotAt` differs from `measuredRouting.snapshotAt` was judged against older measurements — re-read the in-house fields it names before citing it. A `communityRank.revisit.date` in the past means the rank is stale: drop it from the tie-break rather than guess.

**How much a measured row is worth.** Single observer, private tasks, one task per aim, a few runs per cell (the row's `n`), one harness version per row — and every row comes from a **headless top-level session with restricted tools** (the harness's own system prompt, a `node`-only command gate, plugin hooks off). An Agent/Workflow subagent lane runs with a different prompt and toolset: a neighbouring configuration, not the measured one. Treat a row as a prior, not a guarantee. When a lane bound from `measuredRouting` fails its gate, **raise the same model's effort before moving the lane up a tier** (basis: Step 5's "escalate on evidence"); only when that model also fails at its highest effort that reached the aim does the lane return to its reference tier, or follow the table's escalation. Record `(aim, harness, model, effort, outcome)` in the workspace's lane log or board done entry so the next bench run can test the disagreement (SHOULD).

## Step 3 — check availability before you bind

Tier ≠ entitlement. The registry's `planGating` records what each subscription actually exposes, and the gaps bite exactly where fan-out does:

- A frontier model can be *selectable* while its large-context variant needs credits — a wide fan-out on it can silently become a billing event.
- Team/Business seats often do **not** inherit the higher-multiplier headroom of the equivalent personal Pro tier; assuming the paid-team plan buys concurrency is a common planning error.
- Some harnesses' model pickers lag their own vendor API — a picker default can be a model the API has already shut down. Pin explicitly.
- Org policy can cap maximum effort per model per role, and in JSON/stream output or background agents **the clamp can apply silently** — a scripted lane may run below the effort you requested with no signal.
- Invitation-gated models (registry `availability: "restricted access"` — today claude-mythos-5) are listed for **recognition, not planning**: entitlement is per-org/account, so verify the concrete account is enrolled before binding — picker visibility or an allowlist mention is not enrollment.

If the tier you want is unavailable — including an invitation-gated model whose enrollment you could not verify — degrade **down a tier at the same effort** rather than sideways to an unverified model.

## Step 4 — bind per lane, using the harness's own keys

Exact keys per harness live in the registry's `harnessBinding` (Claude Code · Codex CLI · Cursor · Gemini CLI · Kimi Code · router layers). Two rules are spec-level, not data-level:

1. **Prefer per-invocation binding over any global env pin.** Since Claude Code v2.1.251 the plain `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` is only a default that explicit lanes beat; `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL_FORCE=1` (v2.1.257+) is the pin that overrides even explicit per-lane choices, and a value excluded by org allowlist can still be substituted *silently* in headless or scripted sessions (interactive sessions print a warning since v2.1.222). Verify actual application when it matters. (This is also why the Step 0 guard denies rather than sets a default: `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL=sonnet` would stop the frontier leak, but it turns "no choice" into a silent cheap choice — a refutation lane that forgot its `model` would then run on sonnet with no signal. The guard makes the omission visible; it also reads the FORCE variable and refuses while a pin would land lanes on a T1 model.)
2. **Bind effort together with the model.** Effort level names are not comparable across models — vendors state this outright — so a stored global effort number applied to whatever model is active is a meaningless number.

## Step 5 — effort, three load-bearing rules

- **Default first; escalate on evidence, not on principle.** Raise effort when you observed the model skip a file, skip the tests, or not double-check — not because the task feels important. Vendors document the top rung as prone to overthinking with diminishing returns: blanket-max is a documented anti-pattern, not merely expensive.
- **Step DOWN the ladder before stepping ACROSS tiers.** A generation bump usually means the new model's cheap rung beats the old model's expensive rung. Check that before downgrading tier.
- **Effort is a caching decision too.** Changing it mid-conversation invalidates the prompt cache (per model *and* per level). Pick one level at session start and vary effort *across* workloads, not within a cache-dependent session. Note also that low effort changes *tool behavior* — fewer, more combined tool calls — which in a search lane saves more than the token delta suggests.

## Off-signals (turn it back OFF / leave it off)

- Single-file or deep-context work where the main's prompt cache is hot.
- Lanes needing repeated orchestrator↔executor negotiation (round-trip overhead eats the saving).
- Latency-sensitive interactive work.
- Executor output shows style/convention drift the review pass keeps correcting — the correction cost is the signal.

## After every toggle: re-declare

If this workspace is joined to a Constellation board, the toggle is not finished until the board knows: emit an updated `OpsState` carrying `subscaler {on, ...}` alongside the measured model (Constellation §13.23.4 — change-triggered, latest-wins). Toggle + announce are one unit of work. (EG-ops helper: `node scripts/emit-ops-state.cjs`.) Not board-joined → skip.

## Composition

- Superscalar §5.1 — normative spec (tier vocabulary, routing rubric, registry contract, evidence base).
- `/superscalar` §5.2 — dispatch aggressiveness (orthogonal axis: how *many* lanes, not what they run on).
- Superscalar §2 cost-benefit gate · §3 budgets · §3.1 Hyperbrief interlock — all upstream of this toggle.
